# PyQuake
PyQuake is a program that utilizes matplotlib and pandas to access the USGS spreadsheets and visualize earthquake data. Unfortunately, the current version (1.0) does not have the ability to filter data or display heatmaps, frequency charts, line graphs, or time and depth visualizations. Despite these limitations, PyQuake provides users with basic earthquake data analysis and visualizations using Python.

If you wanna run PyQuake, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Code** button then press **Download ZIP**
2. Open the ZIP file
3. Extract the folder to the Desktop

Then, the command prompt will open and PyQuake will begin running.
