# PyQuake
PyQuake is a program that utilizes matplotlib and pandas to access the USGS spreadsheets and visualize earthquake data. Update version 1.0.1 of PyQuake includes the new text-to-speech functionality that enables the program to audibly communicate earthquake data to users. With this new feature, users can listen to the earthquake data and get real-time updates on seismic activity. This update aims to improve the accessibility of PyQuake for visually impaired users and those who prefer audio output.
